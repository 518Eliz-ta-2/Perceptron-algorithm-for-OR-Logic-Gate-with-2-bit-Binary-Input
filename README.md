# Perceptron-algorithm-for-OR-Logic-Gate-with-2-bit-Binary-Input
A beginner-friendly demonstration of how perceptrons can be used to model logic gates. This repo includes Python implementations of  OR using weighted sums and activation thresholds, along with sample tests and output results. You can adjust w,b values  to get other logic gates like AND :)
